                       	   <p>High School seeks to ensure CIA FIRST International School students are fully utilizing the critical thinking skills they have developed in order to consolidate their beliefs and values. By High School, students will have begun identifying their passions and talents, and will start focusing on these specialized areas so they can start excelling to the fullest of their ability.  While Middle School is very much focused on acting as a forum to promote debate and discussion to develop critical thinking, High School is more content-based as students are prepared for vital exams. Students will now be enacting CIA FIRST’s Habits of Mind on a day-to-day basis as they prepare to enter higher education and the professional world.

                       	   <p>By Middle School, students at CIA FIRST International School will continue their self-discovery and will start formulating an individual worldview. The syllabus will open up students to new abstract ideas and expose them to multiple perspectives which will aid their development in thinking. This comes down to the philosophy of not imposing a particular worldview on students. The classroom is seen as a place to promote debate and discussion, allowing students to explore a wealth of opposing ideas to construct their own opinion. CIA FIRST ’s students are at a time of life where they are seeking to establish their own social identity. The middle school curriculum invites the students to explore the big ideas in life.<br><br>

                       	   <p>CIA FIRST believes that elementary learning is one of the most vital parts of nurturing a child for the future. We believe that children experimenting and unearthing concepts and processes themselves, is the best way to develop well-rounded individuals, rather than simply memorizing facts. CIA FIRST believes that working as part of a team is an essential life skill and the school puts emphasis on ensuring children can operate collectively among their peers. This helps build the confidence of children and also leads them to communicate their ideas clearly on an individual basis.  They are provided with instructions aligned to international standards.<br><br><br>
